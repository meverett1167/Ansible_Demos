About these examples
====================

This directory contains examples of how to use the F5 Modules for Ansible to
perform various tasks.

Both F5 and customers contributed these examples. If a customer contributed the example, it likely serves more as an example of
the modules in play than as a drop-in configuration.


Support
=======

The playbooks in this and other directories serve as an *example* of
how to use Ansible to automate configuration of BIG-IP or other F5 products.

These examples are meant to familiarize you with possibilities, and are not formally supported by F5.
